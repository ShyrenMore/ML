Principal Component Analysis is used to reduce dimensions 
code: handwritten digit classification
where numbers are written by hand and we have to predict which number it is 

dataset contains 8*8 grid hence there are 64 features or pixels
boundary pixels will always be black 
what if we get rid of these unimportant features 
then 
1) faster training and inference
2) Data visualisation becomes easier 

when in code we do 
PCA(n_components=6)
we will be extracting 6 most important components or features of the dataset 

In code, we need to scale the features
